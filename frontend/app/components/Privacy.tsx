        StudySprint (the "Service") is a study tracker that lets you log focus sessions, set goals,
        and optionally connect Google Calendar to keep your sessions in sync. This page explains
        what data we collect, what we do with it, and how to delete it.
      </p>

      <h2>What we collect</h2>

      <h3>Account data</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Email address</strong>{' '}
          — required to create an account, used for sign-in and account recovery.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Username, display name, bio</strong>{' '}
          — optional, only set if you choose to make your profile public.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Authentication tokens</strong>{' '}
          — managed by Supabase Auth. We never see or store your password directly; sign-ins via
          Google OAuth never expose your Google credentials to us.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Activity data</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Study goals</strong>{' '}
          — title, description, target hours, target date, subjects you assign.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Study sessions</strong>{' '}
          — duration, optional notes, an optional 1-5 quality rating, the timestamp at which you
          logged the session.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Subject tags</strong>{' '}
          — short text labels (e.g. "Calculus") that you attach to goals. These are stored in a
          shared table; the name itself is global, but no other user can see which goals are yours
          unless your profile is public.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Google Calendar integration (optional)</h3>
      <p>
        If you choose to connect Google Calendar via the Connect Calendar button, we store:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A Google access token and refresh token, scoped to{' '}
          <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events</code>{' '}
          only. These let the Service create, read, update, and delete calendar events on your
          behalf when you explicitly use a related feature (e.g. "Export this session to Calendar").
        </li>
        <li>
          The Calendar event IDs created or imported by the Service, so we can keep StudySprint
          sessions in sync with their Calendar counterparts.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can disconnect Google Calendar at any time from the Dashboard, which deletes the stored
        tokens and unlinks any imported events. Revoking the grant directly at{' '}
        <a href='https://myaccount.google.com/permissions'>
          myaccount.google.com/permissions
        </a>{' '}
        has the same effect.
      </p>

      <h3>Limited Use disclosure (Google API Services)</h3>
      <p>
        StudySprint's use of information received from Google APIs adheres to the{' '}
        <a href='https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#limited-use'>
          Google API Services User Data Policy
        </a>
        , including the Limited Use requirements. Specifically:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>
            We only use Google Calendar data to provide in-app features you initiated
          </strong>{' '}
          — exporting sessions, importing events, listing upcoming events. Nothing happens in the
          background without your action.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>We do not transfer Google user data to third parties</strong>{' '}
          except as needed to provide the Service (e.g. storing tokens in our Supabase backend so
          the Service can call Calendar on your behalf). We do not sell, share, or trade it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>We do not use Google user data for advertising</strong>, ad targeting, or any
          model training of any kind.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>We do not allow humans to read Google user data</strong>, except (1) with your
          explicit consent, (2) for security purposes such as investigating abuse, (3) to comply
          with applicable law, or (4) where the data is aggregated and used for internal operations
          in line with this policy.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What we don't collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We don't track you across other sites.</li>
        <li>We don't run advertising or share data with ad networks.</li>
        <li>We don't sell your data to anyone.</li>
        <li>
          We don't read the body of your Google Calendar events unless you explicitly use the import
          flow on a specific event.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Where your data lives</h2>
      <p>
        StudySprint stores all account, activity, and integration data in a managed{' '}
        <a href='https://supabase.com'>Supabase</a> project (PostgreSQL, hosted in{' '}
        <code>us-west-1</code>). Supabase processes data according to its own{' '}
        <a href='https://supabase.com/privacy'>privacy policy</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application frontend is hosted on Vercel; static asset requests are subject to{' '}
        <a href='https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy'>Vercel's privacy policy</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you use the syllabus parser, the syllabus text you submit is forwarded to{' '}
        <a href='https://openrouter.ai'>OpenRouter</a>{' '}
        (an LLM gateway) which in turn forwards it to one of several free-tier model providers.
        Submitted text may be retained by those providers per their respective terms; please don't
        submit syllabi containing private personal data.
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies and local storage</h2>
      <p>
        We use <code>localStorage</code>{' '}
        and a Supabase session cookie to keep you signed in across page loads. We do not use
        third-party tracking cookies or analytics scripts.
      </p>

      <h2>How to delete your data</h2>
      <p>You can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Reset your account</strong>{' '}
          from the in-app settings menu — this wipes your goals, sessions, and Google Calendar
          tokens, and reinstalls the starter goals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Delete your account entirely</strong>{' '}
          by emailing the contact below. This removes everything: profile, goals, sessions, tokens,
          audit history.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Account deletions are processed within 30 days. Backups containing your data may persist for
        up to 90 days after deletion before being purged.
      </p>

      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>
        StudySprint is not directed at children under 13. If you are under 13, please don't create
        an account. If we learn that we've collected data from a child under 13 without parental
        consent, we'll delete it.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        If this policy materially changes, we'll update the "Last updated" date at the top and, for
        active accounts, send a notice via email. By continuing to use the Service after such a
        change, you accept the revised policy.
      </p>
