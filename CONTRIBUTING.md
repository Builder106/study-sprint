# Contributing to StudySprint

Thanks for taking the time to contribute. This guide covers the workflow,
project conventions, and what to check before opening a PR.

## Getting set up

Requires [Deno 2.x](https://deno.com/) and the
[Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli). There is no
`package.json` — `deno.json` is the source of truth for tasks and npm
dependencies.

```bash
deno install                        # materialize node_modules from deno.json
cp .env.example .env                # fill VITE_SUPABASE_URL / VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
deno task supabase:link             # link to your Supabase project
deno task dev                       # frontend :5173 (Vite via Deno)
```

Sign up via the in-app register flow to create your account. See
[README.md](README.md#environment-variables) for the full env-var list.

If `deno install` warns about ignored build scripts, re-run with
`deno install --allow-scripts=npm:supabase,npm:@tailwindcss/oxide`.

## Project layout

```
frontend/  React + Vite SPA (run via `deno task dev`)
  app/components/   page-level components
  lib/              Supabase client, API wrappers, hooks, utilities
supabase/
  migrations/       SQL schema, views, RPC definitions
  functions/        Deno Edge Functions (shared deno.json import map)
e2e/       Playwright + Gherkin BDD suite (QA + demo configs)
deno.json  Tasks, npm imports, fmt + lint config
```

## Workflow

1. Branch off `main` (`git checkout -b feat/short-description`).
2. Make focused commits. Keep unrelated changes in separate PRs.
3. Run `deno task test` locally before pushing.
4. Open a PR against `main` with a description of *why* the change is needed,
   not just *what* it does.

## Commit messages

This repo follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
Prefixes in active use:

- `feat(scope): ...` — user-visible new behavior
- `fix(scope): ...` — bug fix
- `chore(scope): ...` — tooling, deps, internal cleanup
- `docs: ...` — documentation only

Scope is the area touched (`auth`, `goals`, `sessions`, `syllabus`, `community`,
`db`, `gamification`, etc.). Keep the subject under ~72 characters and write
in the imperative mood.

Do not add `Co-Authored-By` trailers attributing work to AI assistants.

## Code style

- TypeScript strict mode is on; don't disable it per-file.
- Prefer accessible UI primitives (Radix, semantic HTML). New components should
  reach for `getByRole`-friendly markup so E2E tests can target them without
  `data-testid`.
- Tailwind v4 conventions — utility classes inline, use `clsx` / `tailwind-merge`
  for conditional classes.
- Format with `deno task fmt`. Lint with `deno task lint`. Both run on the
  frontend tree and the Supabase functions tree.
- New Supabase tables / RPCs go in a timestamped file under
  `supabase/migrations/`.
- Don't add comments that restate what the code does. Reserve them for
  non-obvious *why*.

## Adding dependencies

```bash
deno add npm:<package>@<version>          # frontend dep
```

This updates `deno.json` and re-materializes `node_modules`. For Edge Function
deps, add them to `supabase/functions/deno.json` instead.

## Tests

```bash
deno task test:setup      # one-time per machine: bootstrap the demo account
deno task test            # Gherkin E2E suite, headless
deno task test:e2e:ui     # Playwright UI mode for debugging
deno task demo            # records narrated walkthrough videos (DEMO=1)
```

### Test fixtures

Most non-auth scenarios begin with `Given I am logged in as
"demo@studysprint.app"`. That account has to exist in Supabase Auth for
the suite to clear the login screen, so the suite ships with
[`e2e/setup/bootstrap-demo.ts`](e2e/setup/bootstrap-demo.ts) which
create-or-updates it and reseeds starter goals.

Required env vars (for the bootstrap, **not** for the suite itself):

```bash
export SUPABASE_URL=https://<project-ref>.supabase.co
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<service-role>   # Project Settings → API
deno task test:setup
```

The service-role key never leaves your machine — `bootstrap-demo.ts` is
the only place that needs it, and it's not used by the running suite or
the application itself. Don't commit it.

E2E tests themselves run with the publishable anon key only (read from
`VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in your `.env`). The
suite skips cleanup of registered users in scenarios that test sign-up;
periodically sweep them with:

```sql
delete from auth.users where email like 'demo_signup_%@studysprint.app';
```

When adding a feature:

- Add or extend a Gherkin scenario in `e2e/features/`. Write step text as
  natural English (`When I click the "Save" button`), not selectors.
- Reuse step definitions from `e2e/steps/` where possible. Add new steps only
  when no existing phrasing fits.
- Cleanup of test-created rows belongs in `After` hooks via API requests, not
  direct DB access. See `e2e/steps/hooks.ts`.
- See [e2e/AGENTS.md](e2e/AGENTS.md) for detailed conventions on locators,
  hydration, and the demo-recording infrastructure.

Validation / error-path scenarios are high-value — keep them. Plain
"page renders" smoke tests for features that already have CRUD coverage are
not worth the upkeep.

## Database changes

- Schema changes ship as a new file in `supabase/migrations/` (timestamped).
- Don't edit a migration that has already been applied to the deployed
  database. Add a follow-up migration instead.
- If the change affects RLS, include the policy in the same migration.

## Reporting bugs

Open a GitHub issue with:

- What you expected vs. what happened
- Reproduction steps (account state, exact clicks/inputs)
- Browser + OS, or `deno --version` for tooling bugs
- Relevant excerpt from the browser console or function logs (`supabase functions logs`)
