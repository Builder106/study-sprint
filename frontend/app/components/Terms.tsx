    <LegalLayout title='Terms of service' lastUpdated='May 7, 2026'>
      <p>
        These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of StudySprint (the
        "Service"). By creating an account or using the Service you agree to these Terms. If you
        don't agree, don't use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>What StudySprint is</h2>
      <p>
        StudySprint is a personal project — a study tracker that lets you log focus sessions, set
        goals, see a study charge build as you study, and (optionally) sync with Google Calendar.
        It's offered free of charge, with no warranties, and is not a commercial product.
      </p>

      <h2>Your account</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You're responsible for everything that happens under your account.</li>
        <li>Don't share your credentials with anyone.</li>
        <li>
          Don't impersonate someone else or sign up using someone else's email without permission.
        </li>
        <li>One person, one account.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Acceptable use</h2>
      <p>You agree not to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the Service to break any law or anyone else's rights.</li>
        <li>
          Submit content that's harassing, defamatory, sexually explicit involving minors, or that
          infringes on intellectual property you don't own.
        </li>
        <li>
          Try to extract data you weren't given access to — including probing for vulnerabilities,
          scraping other users' data, or attempting to bypass row-level security.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the syllabus parser to process content you don't have the right to share with
          third-party LLM providers (your syllabus is forwarded to OpenRouter; see our{' '}
          <a href='/privacy'>privacy policy</a> for details).
        </li>
        <li>
          Generate disproportionate load on the Service (e.g. automated scripts firing many requests
          per second).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you violate these rules we may suspend or delete your account without notice.
      </p>

      <h2>Your content</h2>
      <p>
        You retain ownership of everything you submit (goals, sessions, notes, syllabus text,
        profile copy). By submitting it you grant StudySprint a non-exclusive license to store and
        process it for the sole purpose of providing the Service to you. We don't claim ownership
        and we don't relicense your content to anyone else.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-party services</h2>
      <p>
        Parts of the Service depend on third-party providers — Supabase (database + auth), Vercel
        (hosting), Google (Calendar API and OAuth), and OpenRouter (syllabus parsing LLM gateway).
        Their terms and privacy policies apply when you use the corresponding features. The Service
        can stop working at any time if any of these dependencies change or become unavailable, and
        we're not liable for those outages.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is provided <strong>"as is"</strong> and{' '}
        <strong>"as available"</strong>, with no warranties of any kind — express, implied, or
        statutory. We don't guarantee the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or that
        data will never be lost. We don't warrant that any analytics, charge calculations, or
        gamification rewards are correct.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, StudySprint and its contributors will not be liable
        for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages arising
        out of or related to your use of the Service. Total cumulative liability for any direct
        damages is capped at $0 (the amount you've paid for the Service).
      </p>

      <h2>Termination</h2>
      <p>
        You can stop using the Service at any time. We can suspend or terminate your access at any
        time, with or without notice, especially if you violate these Terms. On termination, your
        right to use the Service ends immediately. Sections of these Terms that by their nature
        should survive termination (your content license to us for anything still stored,
        disclaimers, liability limits) will survive.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to these Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms occasionally. If a change is material we'll update the "Last
        updated" date and, for active accounts, notify you via email. Continued use after a change
        means you accept the new Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>Governing law</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Connecticut, USA, without regard to
        conflicts-of-law principles. Disputes will be resolved in the state or federal courts
        located in Connecticut, and you consent to the personal jurisdiction of those courts.
